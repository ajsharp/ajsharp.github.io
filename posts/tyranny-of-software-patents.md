# Software Patents and the Ownership of Ideas

Software patents are terrible for innovation and the technology industry as a whole, because
they allow companies to purchase ideas, something that is horribly anti-competitive and downright scary. A patent
on an idea is a legal technicality that gives the patent holder the legal authority to ensure
other companies don't create or attempt to create the same idea. The owner of the idea (patent)
can extort payment from a would-be competitor, lest the competitor risk costly legal action.
What this means is that big companies and/or patent trolls can tie up other companies in court 
and bleed them dry with legal fees based on nothing more than an idea. 

[A new article in Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/17/are-patent-trolls-now-zeroed-in-on-start-ups/)
details a recent rise in patent trolls targeting startups.

Take a step back and consider what this means -- companies can **own ideas.**
We're not talking about ownership rights to a specific technology, product, piece of code, design, or
any other *actual invention*. We're talking about *ideas*. Companies can carve out entire market
segments without building anything at all. All they need do is claim ownership of an idea by 
filing a patent application. Large technology companies have been [doing this for years](http://deoxy.org/swpc.htm).
To many of these companies it's purely a risk-management play -- patent an idea that they might want
to someday build, and as a bonus, they get the right to sue anyone else for coming up with the same idea and
actually building it. Think domain squatting, but much, much worse.

So, if you believe that ideas are cheap, and that execution is what matters, this should be *extremely*
offensive to you. Our patent system effectively rewards both non-executers and those first-to-market
(or patent application) with ownership of ideas for doing nothing except filing some documents. 
You needn't have a product, just the idea. Come up with an idea, file some papers, and boom, you 
own it. That patent arms the owner with the right to sue the pants off anyone else who attempts 
to execute on that idea. In normal business, we might call that *competition*, but our patent 
system makes it a criminal act. It's a fabulously effective way to shield oneself from having to 
build a competitive product (or any product at all, for that matter).

And here's the worst part -- it's not *just* the bad apples that take part in this behavior -- 
it's everyone. This phenomenon is what political scientists might call an "arms race". Businesses 
file patents because they assume their competitors will do the same, so patents are often 
filed as a protective measure, to shield from potential liability from legal action, by ensuring
their competitors don't get the patent first.

This absurd behavior has been going on for decades, and will continue unchecked until we
make drastic changes to our patent system. 
We must change our patent laws to disallow the ownership of ideas in software. Ideas are simply 
not the same as inventions or designs. Treating them as such hampers innovation, raises costs 
and reduces choice for consumers, it measurably raises the cost of starting a business, and 
creates effective mini-monopolies and oligopolies in different market segments.

[Ideas are indeed precious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGI76__sSA

on them. Software patents that enable ownership of ideas immeasurably reduce the ability to execute 
from anyone but the patent owner, and we must change that.
